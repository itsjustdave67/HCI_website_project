              A sperm fertilizes an egg when it is released from the ovary
              during ovulation to cause pregnancy. After that, the fertilized
              egg descends into the uterus, where implantation takes place. An
              effective implantation leads to conception.

                You may notice some signs and symptoms before you even take a
                pregnancy test. Others will appear weeks later, as your hormone
                levels change.

              <h4 class="Preg_1st_content_title"><u>Missed period</u></h4>
              <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                One of the first signs of pregnancy is a missed period (and
                maybe the most classic one). Even if your cycle is irregular, a
                missed period does not always indicate that you are
                pregnant.There are many health conditions other than pregnancy
                that can cause a late or missed period.

              <h4 class="Preg_1st_content_title"><u>Headache</u></h4>
              <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                Early in a pregnancy, headaches are frequent. They are typically
                brought on by elevated blood volume and changed hormone levels.
                If your headaches don't go away or if they're particularly
                painful, call your doctor.
              </p>
              <h4 class="Preg_1st_content_title"><u>Spotting</u></h4>
              <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                Early in pregnancy, some women may suffer minor bleeding and
                spotting. The most frequent cause of this bleeding is
                implantation. Typically, one to two weeks after fertilization,
                implants take place. Additionally, relatively simple issues like
                an infection or irritation might cause early pregnancy bleeding.
                The latter frequently affects the cervix's surface (which is
                very sensitive during pregnancy).<br /><br />
              </p>
              <p>
                A major pregnancy issue, such as a miscarriage, an ectopic
                pregnancy, or a placenta previa, can occasionally be detected by
                bleeding. In case you have any worries, always call your doctor.

              <p class="_content_paragraph">
                During the first trimester, a baby grows quickly (weeks 1 to
                12). The fetus starts to form its organs, spinal cord, and
                brain. The infant's heart will start to beat as well.<br /><br />

                likelihood of miscarriage is relatively high during the first
                trimester. The American College of Obstetricians and
                Gynecologists (ACOG) estimates that one in ten pregnancies
                terminate in miscarriage, with the first trimester accounting
                for roughly 85% of these losses. If you have miscarriage
                symptoms, get help right once.
              </p>

              <h4 class="Preg_1st_content_title"><u>Second trimester</u></h4>
              <p class="_content_paragraph">
                Your healthcare practitioner will probably carry out an
                ultrasound anatomy scan throughout the second trimester of
                pregnancy (weeks 13 to 27). This test looks for any anomalies in
                the fetus's physical development. If you want to know your
                baby's sex before the baby is born, the test results can also
                tell you that. Your baby will probably start to move, kick, and
                punch inside your uterus.<br /><br />

                A kid in utero is deemed "viable" after 23 weeks. This implies
                that it could be able to survive outside of your womb. Babies
                that are born so early frequently have major medical problems.
                The longer you are able to carry the pregnancy, the greater the
                likelihood that your baby will be born healthy.
              </p>

                Your weight growth will quicken throughout the third trimester

                light. They also develop bones.Your feet may swell and you can
                experience pelvic discomfort as birth gets closer. The weeks
                prior to delivery may see the onset of Braxton-Hicks
                contractions, which are contractions that do not progress into
                labor. <br /><br />

                Depending on how you normally like to snooze, you might have to
                rethink your favourite position while you're pregnant.If you
                sleep on your back, it's safe to continue during the first
                trimester, but as your bump gets bigger and heavier you'll need
                to sleep on your side, so it's best to get into the habit as
                soon as you can.<br /><br />

                By the third trimester (after 28 weeks of pregnancy), sleeping
                on your side is the safest position for your baby as it helps
                prevent the risk of stillbirth. Don't worry, if your pregnancy
                is uncomplicated your risk of stillbirth is low (1 in 200 babies
                are stillborn) and going to sleep on your side will make it even
                lower.

                temperature greater than 102 degrees, as we do not want

                If you were not exercising regularly before becoming pregnant, 
                you should not start anything rigorous. But walking, jogging,
