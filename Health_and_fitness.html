              The "donts" Of Health and Nutrition
            </h4>
            Just Don’t do it. The following can have very serious harmful
            effects on your baby’s development:
            <ul class="Trimester_list">
              <li>
                <strong> Caffeinated drinks </strong>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  Caffeinated drinks are for example the variety of espressos
                  and energy drinks. These drinks contains a relatively high
                  amount of sugar that is usually not good for the random human
                  being. Now. In your case as a pregnant it will increase your
                  blood pressure and hand in hand your heart rate. It also
                  causes you to produce more urine than what is expected of a
                  pregnant lady.<br /><br />
                </p>

                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  The high caffeine takes a longer period to be removed from
                  your body and therefore has side effects on you. It can make
                  you to become light headed and nauseous. Since all your
                  nutrients consumption are for you and your baby, in the long
                  run the baby also consumes the caffeine. Some studies support
                  the thesis that is causes miscarriages and preterm birth so
                  generally avoid it. Therefore avoid it in all circumstances
                  but if you must drink coffee take only 200mg a day.<br /><br />
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong> Alcohol </strong>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  Alcohol is an obvious “don’t” during pregnancy. Even you as a
                  person can’t handle liquor well so why should a new being
                  introduced to a new environment be able to cope with it. Your
                  baby in general cannot process alcohol well and their exposure
                  to it is very detrimental to their development.
                  <br /><br />
                </p>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  Alcohol increases the risks of miscarriages, premature birth,
                  you baby being born below weight, deformation of organs and
                  limbs and later on can cause issues to them after they’re
                  born. In fact it can cause one to develop a serious condition
                  known as Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).<br /><br />
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>3. Smoking Cigarettes</strong>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  Smoking while pregnant is very risky since in general smoking
                  cigarettes has been deemed as a complete detrimental habit
                  with absolutely no benefits. It causes tissue damage to the
                  brain and lungs of the baby. It also increases the risks of
                  miscarriages and low development of babies due to lack of
                  sufficient oxygen.<br /><br />
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong> Under-cooked meat</strong>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  All under-cooked meat is bad for both you and the baby since
                  it can cause food poisoning for both you and the baby. The
                  baby’s immune system is still developing and such bacteria
                  exposure can cause still-births. So make sure all your meat
                  whether pregnant or not, is cooked properly.<br /><br />

                <strong>5. Seafood that contains mercury</strong>
                <p class="_content_paragraph _cp">
                  Mercury in any types of food is very poisonous to all human
                  beings. So you can imagine what kind of unfathomable damage it
                  can do to your child. If you have to partake Seafood make sure
                  it is well done.<br /><br />

                This means that you are doing too much exercise and need to cut down on the amount of strain and effort you put on your body right now. Hydrate and take good rests between your workout sessions.
Consult your doctor if the conditions persist with reduced exercise.
